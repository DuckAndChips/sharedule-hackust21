# Sharedule
Sharedule is a web application that hybridizes a shared calendar and a shared to-do list for a family.

The source code can be found in the `master` branch. The web app can be initiated by running `node index.js` on console in the directory. The website will be hosted on port 3000 under a local environment.

**Libraries/Framework used**: `jQuery`, `jQuery-UI` for more flexible dialogs, `Node.js` and `Express.js` as the backend framework, `FullCalendar` (https://fullcalendar.io/) for calendar systems and `neDB` for the database.
